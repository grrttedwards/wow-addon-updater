Replaced Pipenv with poetry.

* 01/19/2020 - v1.5.2

Enhance support for Curse classic-only addons. Now those addons can download if the page only supports one release, and that release is the classic game version.

Lastly, added support for any generic GitHub-hosted addon (thanks @Hjaltesorgenfrei)!

* 8/11/2019 - Large internal project refactor. As a result, new commands to install and execute the module. Details in the README.md.

* 8/7/2019 - Took over development of this great dead project. Improved run time by a huge factor (it should run in just a few seconds total, vs. a few seconds PER addon update).
